# Learning Common Lisp in a Month

I'm challenging myself to learn Common Lisp in one month (November 27 - December 27 2018). I will be posting every day inside this repository detailing what I did that day in order to advance my knowledge. You'll be able to find a list of the posts here. If I miss a day, you'll have the chance to have me send you $5. Just tweet at [me](https://twitter.com/TomLisankie) claiming it, DM me your PayPal info, and I'll send you your money (limit of 5 people per missed post).
