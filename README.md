# Learning Common Lisp

I'm challenging myself to learn Common Lisp in one month intervals (current period is November 27 - December 27 2018). I will be posting every day inside this repository detailing what I did that day in order to advance my knowledge. You'll be able to find a list of the posts here. If I miss a day, you'll have the chance to have me send you $5. Just tweet at [me](https://twitter.com/TomLisankie) claiming it, DM me your PayPal info, and I'll send you your money (limit of 5 people per missed post). I'm going by Eastern Standard Time (NYC time).

To find out *why* I'm doing this, check out the first section of the [first post](posts/Nov2018/27.md).
