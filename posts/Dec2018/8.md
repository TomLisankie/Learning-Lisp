# Day 11

Today I fixed my awful code from yesterday. It's now far cleaner and faster. Also, thanks to Rainer Joswig for his [comment](https://github.com/TomLisankie/Learning-Lisp/commit/eb70c74a10ea231d29f38b2ff0b422aa471cf9de#r31608966) earlier today.

I also mostly did part 2 of day 1 of this year's Advent of Code. This time, I'm not exhausted and my code is far nicer the first time around. Code is in today's folder. It still doesn't work, but I have a feeling I'm close. I don't know why my final conditional isn't firing off.

I think I'm gonna do a few days worth of AoC problems one of these upcoming days.
