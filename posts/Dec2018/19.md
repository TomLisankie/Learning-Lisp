# Day 22

Today I learned about how trees are constructed in Lisp using cons cells. Basically one way of thinking about a tree is just as a list of lists. And as I covered a few days ago, lists are just cons cells linked to one another. The way a tree is structured with cons cells is by havingnot just the `cdr` link to another cons cell, but instead by having both the `car` and `cdr` of cons cells point to other cons cells.

For example, let's create a tree structure made up of cons cells:

```commonlisp
(cons (cons 1 (cons "entry" (cons 3 nil))) (cons (cons 4 (cons 5 (cons "six" nil))) nil)) ;==> ((1 "entry" 3) (4 5 "six"))
```

With this set-up, we have a tree structure with two separate branches. In the first branch, 3 is a child of "entry" which is a child of 1. In the second, "six" is a child of 5 which is a child of 4.

The functions `copy-list` and `copy-tree` may look like they're doing the same thing on the surface, but this is not the case. `copy-list` just makes a new list that references the exact same cons cells in memory as the original list whereas `copy-tree` makes a new list that contains copies of the cons cells from the original.
