# Day 23

Today's post is short: I briefly read about sets in CL. Sets and lists in Lisp are made the exact same way. For sets in Lisp, you can use the `adjoin` function to add to the set. However, `adjoin` doesn't actually update the original list/set you pass into it. Instead, you'll have to do a `setf` on the original list with the `adjoin` form as the new value. However, this is overly laborious so if you want to update the original list with less effort, you can just use the `pushnew` macro.

There are also operations for doing set-theoretic activities like intersections, unions, and set-difference.

There's also a subset function called `subsetp`.
