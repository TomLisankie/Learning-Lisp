# Day 12

Spent most of my Lisp time today trying to figure out what on Earth I'm doing wrong with my code for part b of problem 1 for Advent of Code 2018. After staring at this code and trying out a few different things for 45 minutes, I realized that I was making a hash table entry for each of the numbers in the `input.txt` file as opposed to an entry for each sum. I quickly changed this but it still wasn't working. And I still have no idea why. I'm getting some error that states "the value NIL is not of type NUMBER." Throwing in the towel on this one tonight. It's gotta be something with regards to creating a new key in the hash table. But I have absolutely no idea what.

Code is in the appropriate folder.
