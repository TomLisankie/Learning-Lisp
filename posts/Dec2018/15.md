# Day 18

Gonna have to keep this short because I'm very busy today. Today I'm reading about lists in Lisp. Lisp's take on lists is what allows it to use code as data and vice-versa. Only going to read the first section (excluding intro) of [this](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/they-called-it-lisp-for-a-reason-list-processing.html) chapter from PCL.

The first thing I learned was that lists in CL basically don't actually exist. They're a series of connected what are called "cons cells." These seem to basically be a map from one value to another. The first entry in a cons cell is called the `car` and the second is called the `cdr`. Cons cells are mutable too. So you can perform `setf` on either the `car` or the `cdr`. So here's a code example:

```commonlisp
(defparameter *sample-cons* (cons 20 "hello")) ; ==> (20 . "hello")
(setf (car *sample-cons*) 5)
*sample-cons* ; ==> (5 . "hello")
```

This makes a global cons cell variable with a `car` of 20 and a `cdr` of "hello". Then we change the `car` to be 5.

Lists are made by linking cons cells together where the `car`s contain list elements and the `cdr`s are references to the next cons cell in the chain. The last `cdr` will always be `nil`. Sound familiar? It's just a singly-linked list.
