# Day 15

Today I decided to build a simple journaling program. It takes a folder location as input, you write what you want to write, and then it saves the contents of a file to the folder you specified in a file called `journal.txt`. I tried to use a package called "simple-date-time" to save each entry with the current date as the file name. I was able to import the module but I couldn't figure out during the time I had alotted for this how to get the current date from it. Since no new file is made for each entry, I spent some time figure out how to just append to a file instead of overwriting it. Turns out, you can just set the `if-exists` keyword to `:append`. Convenient! Definitely thought I was gonna have to write my own function to do this for a minute.

So, the user experience is complete trash right now but, hey, gotta start somewhere. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The code is in the appropriate folder.
