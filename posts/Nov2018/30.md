# Day 3

Today I didn't do much reading about CL, but I did at work last night. Specifically, I read Paul Graham's essays ["Beating The Averages"](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html) (on how Lisp helped give him and Robert Morris a huge competitive advantage when they were working on Viaweb) and the beginning of ["The Roots of Lisp."](http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html). I also read a little bit of [On Lisp](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf).

Today, I wrote a short tip calculator program to drive home some of the stuff I already know about Lisp. It's available in this repo under `code/Nov2018/30`. One thing I found surprising is that Common Lisp doesn't have a built-in function for parsing decimal types from strings. It does, however, have one for parsing integers out of strings aptly named `parse-integer`. I guess I'm gonna have to write my own macro for this to extend the syntax myself. But for now it just works with integer values.
